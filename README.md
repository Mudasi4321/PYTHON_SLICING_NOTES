# PYTHON_SLICING_NOTES
For revising during exams 
List slicing is a fundamental technique for extracting a portion of a list by specifying optional start, stop, and step indices.

**General Syntax:** `list[start:stop:step]`

## The List

We will use the following lists for the examples:

```python
x = [3, 82, 7, 9, 13, 0, 12]
z = [3, 4, 82, 7, 9, 13, 0, 14]
